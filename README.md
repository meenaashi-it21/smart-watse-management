# smart-watse-management
The purpose of this project is to identify the below functions :

Authorities are not intimated properly or they aren't aware of the level of dustbins whether it has been filled or not.
So, If waste is dumped in the dustbin for a long time, hazardous gasses are produced by which toxicity level increases. Hence, public people, especially sweepers and cleaners, are prone to diseases. 
Hence, through this mobile application, we can intimate the authorities to clear the waste once the bins are filled and measure the toxicity of waste to ensure whether it can be used for recycling. 
Also, the display near the bins is to make people aware not to over dump and also to search for other bins for disposal of waste.
